This is the repository of the booklet "Curative! The No-Nonsense Guide to Your Own Backyard, PopUp, Punk NFT Art Exhibition". 

It contains the booklet plus additional material such as:

* a list of inspiring [exhibitions](Exhibitions.md)
* a [technical checklist](SetupWindows11.md) to run an screen from a Windows 11 PC
* a [technical checklist](SetupRaspberryPi.md) to run a screen from a Raspberry PI

I intend to update the booklet and materials for some time.
