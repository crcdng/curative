This is the repository of the booklet "Curative! The No-Nonsense Guide to Your Own Backyard, PopUp, Punk NFT Art Exhibition". 

It contains the [booklet](Curative.pdf) plus additional material such as:

* links to inspiring [exhibitions](Exhibitions.md)
* a basic [budget template](BasicBudget.csv) 
* a [technical checklist](SetupWindows11.md) to run an screen from a Windows 11 PC
* another [technical checklist](SetupRaspberryPi.md) to run a screen from a Raspberry PI
* a list of the [hardware](4ScreensHardware.md) used for the [4 screens](https://www.dekabinett.xyz/4-screens) exhibition

I am planning to update the booklet and materials for some time.

Many thanks to despace Berlin / TZConnect / Tezos Foundation for support.
